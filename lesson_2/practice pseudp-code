1) a method that returns the sum of two integers

ask the user for the first number
save the number in a variable
remember to convert the string to an integer

ask the user for the second number
save the number in a variable
remember to convert the string to an integer

print the sum of both numbers

GET first number from user?
SET the number to a variable = number1

GET second number from user?
SET the number to variable = number2

PRINT number 1 + number2


2) a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

Given an array of strings

create a method that passes that array
create a variable to store an empty string
iterate through each string in array
insert each string to the store string

set empty string
Set method
Iterate though array
insert strings
print concatenated string

3) a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

initialise a new array
create a method that takes an array of integers
iterate through each element in this arrays
